I designed and developed custom web interfaces and user experiences for multiple projects.

## Description

I built web interfaces with <Highlighter action="underline" color="#94a3b8">WordPress</Highlighter>, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery, and created UI/UX designs and prototypes with Adobe XD and Figma. I applied responsive design principles to deliver a consistent experience across devices and platforms.
