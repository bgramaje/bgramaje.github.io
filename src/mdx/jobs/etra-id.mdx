I contribute to European R&D projects within the Horizon 2020 framework and provide technical leadership for several I+D initiatives focused on innovative software solutions.

## Description

I design and build data management platforms and enterprise applications, and implement <Highlighter action="underline" color="#94a3b8">custom microservices</Highlighter> in Python and JavaScript—containerized with Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes. I also develop embedded software with Arduino and PlatformIO for <Highlighter action="underline" color="#94a3b8">IoT applications</Highlighter>.

## Key Achievements

<Highlighter action="underline" color="#22d3ee">**Digital twin and data visualization platform.**</Highlighter> I architected and developed an abstract data visualization and digital twin platform for remote management across diverse use cases. A suite of microservices ingests data via HTTP, MQTT, and AMQP, built on Node.js with the MeteorJS full-stack framework for real-time capabilities.

<Highlighter action="underline" color="#a78bfa">**Scalable transportation management system.**</Highlighter> I designed and implemented a system with Node.js, MongoDB, and InfluxDB, supporting high-throughput data processing and efficient handling of large-scale datasets.

<Highlighter action="underline" color="#34d399">**FIWARE for Indoor Air Quality.**</Highlighter> I led the adaptation and customization of the FIWARE open-source platform for IAQ monitoring applications, providing standardized tools and APIs for smart solutions.

<Highlighter action="underline" color="#eab308">**Parking IoT with LoRaWAN.**</Highlighter> I developed an embedded solution using LoRaWAN and ESP-32 microcontrollers for intelligent remote management of parking infrastructure and dynamic resource allocation.
